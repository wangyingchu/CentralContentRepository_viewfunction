Filenet CE core Interface Summary
Annotation	Represents an annotation that can be applied to a document, folder, or custom object.
BatchItemHandle	References objects for batch operations.
ComponentRelationship	Defines a hierarchical relationship between two documents as components in a compound document.
Connection	Represents a logical connection to a FileNet P8 domain.
Containable	Represents the base class for all objects that can be contained.
ContainmentRelationship	Models containment relationships.
ContentElement	Represents the superclass for classes used to access document or annotation content data.
ContentReference	Represents external content data that exists outside of an object store (and therefore outside the control of the Content Engine server), but to which an object store 

maintains a reference.
ContentTransfer	Represents content data that is local to an object store and directly managed by the Content Engine server.
CustomObject	Represents a general interface that can be subclassed.
DependentObject	Indicates objects that are dependent.
Document	Represents a single version of a document stored in an object store.
Domain	Represents a collection of resources and services sharing the same Global Configuration Database (GCD).
DynamicReferentialContainmentRelationship	Represents a dynamic relationship between two Containable subclasses: a container and the current version of a Document.
EngineObject	Represents the top-level interface from which most of the other Content Engine API interfaces derive.
EntireNetwork	Represents the highest-level object in the Content Engine API object model.
Folder	Represents a container that can hold other Containable subclasses, but cannot have content data of its own.
IndependentlyPersistableObject	Represents a persistable IndependentObject that you can directly create, update, and delete.
IndependentObject	Indicates objects that are independent.
InstantiatingScope	Provides a generic means for instantiating independent objects within a scope.
Link	Represents a relationship between two objects.
ObjectReference	Provides a means to retrieve identity information about an object.
ObjectStore	Represents a location in which folders, documents, and custom objects are stored, accessed, and managed on the Content Engine server.
ReferentialContainmentRelationship	Represents a static relationship between two Containable subclasses: a container and a containee.
Relationship	Represents the base class for binary relationships between independently persistable objects of an object store.
RepositoryObject	Indicates objects that are repository objects.
Scope	Defines the originating "scope" (enclosing context) of an object, such as the Domain of a Site or ObjectStore, or the ObjectStore of a Document.
Subscribable	Serves as a target of an event subscription, represented by a Subscription-based object.
Versionable	Represents the base class for classes whose instances are versionable objects.
VersionSeries	Represents the complete set of versions for a versionable object, or document (that is, an object instantiated from a subinterface of the Versionable interface).
WorkflowDefinition	Represents a workflow definition, an XML document of class "WorkflowDefinition" that is stored in a Content Engine object store.
